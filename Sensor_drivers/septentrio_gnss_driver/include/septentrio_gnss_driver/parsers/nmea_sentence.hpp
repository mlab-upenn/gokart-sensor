/**
 * @brief Struct to split an NMEA sentence into its ID and its body, the latter
 * tokenized into a vector of strings.
 *
 * By ID, we mean either a standardized ID, e.g. "$GPGGA", or proprietary ID such as
 * "$PSSN,HRP". The STL Container Vector can be used to dynamically allocate arrays
 * (C++ feature). Also note that the ID of !all! (not just those defined by
 * Septentrio) proprietary NMEA messages starts with "$P". The body_ member variable
 * shall exclude the NMEA checksum (also hinted at in files that implement the
 * parsing).

// C++ library includes
#include <stdexcept>
// The C++ Standard library provides a base class specifically designed to declare
// objects to be thrown as exceptions. It is called std::exception and is defined in
// the <exception> header. This class has a virtual member function called what that
// returns a null-terminated character sequence (of type char *) and that can be
// overwritten in derived classes to contain some sort of description of the
// exception. Example Code for using base class exception:
/*
class myexception: public exception
{
    virtual const char* what() const throw()
    {
        return "My exception happened";
    }
} myex;

int main () {
    try
    {
        throw myex;
    }
    catch (exception& e)
    {
        cout << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}

/**
 * @class ParseException

 * @brief Class to declare error message format when parsing, derived from the public
 * class "std::runtime_error"
 *
 * Such error messages shall be thrown whenever a parser class has an unrecoverable
 * issue parsing a message.. Note that "std::runtime_error" is already a class
 * derived from the base class "exception". Note on "explicit" keyword: When a class
 * has a constructor which can be called with a single argument (since arguments
 * might be set to some values by default), then this constructor becomes a
 * conversion constructor, since it allows the !implicit! conversion of the single
 * argument to the full class. We can avoid such implicit conversions as these may
 * lead to unexpected results by making the constructor explicit with the help of the
 * "explicit" keyword.
